The breakfast was plentiful, although the bread was a bit hard.
Either way, it was a good start for a day full of cycling.
The game of the day was basically to follow the Baker river, which starts from Bertrand lake.
The river is a hot spot for people doing rafting or kayaking because of its rapids.
The colour of the river is also its main attraction, as it changes along the way.
At the start is deep green/blue, which I follow just separated by trees and every now and then a holiday lodges or huts.

The first big stop was to see the confluence of the Baker and Nef river.
As a glacier fed river, the colour of the Nef river is milky green like the Exploradores river, so at the junction the colour of the Baker changes to emerald.
To get to this junction is necessary to walk through a well marked path, which I tackled after leaving the bike behind a bus stop (without lock).
When I arrived there I was alone but on the way back a few foreigners were walking to see the junction, two of them asked me how far it was.
It turned out the two guys were a guy driving along the carretera and the other a cyclist that got bored of the gravel and was picked up by the other guy.
As I was leaving the couple from the hostel was just arriving.

So far the road had been flat, but soon after the first climb brought loose dirt and a machine fixing the road, but it felt that it was making it worse.
I stopped a couple of times to look down to the river, which gets into a canyon in this section.
I had food at the top of the climb, a long stretch of straight road between mountains without any forest, just shrubs.
As the road was getting further from the river, the landscape turned more brownish.

The next descent got me to the junction of the Baker and Chacabuco rivers.
Right after the crossing the bridge over the Chacabuco river the next climb starts.
I felt a car coming behind me, and it felt like they were waiting to see if I can get through the first hairpin which was really steep and dusty.
Giving my previous experience in the cuesta Queulat, I kept calm and was able to climb without stopping.
Near the top, the entrance to the Patagonia National Park told me I was getting close to Cochrane.
Since I didn't know whether the camping sites were open in this area of the park (which is managed by a different foundation), I didn't plan to enter here.
However, I stopped on the lookout next to the road for a view of the Baker canyon and the river junction from far up.
