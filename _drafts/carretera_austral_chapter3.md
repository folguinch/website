The day started once again with rain. Straight out of Chaiten three dogs
were following me and barking, but none had enough stamina to keep up with me.
After this scare, the road was quite quiet, with not many cars or trucks. So
far, they have been well behaved and passed me respecting the 1.5m of distance.
Many locals told me to be careful, but drivers were more careful maybe because
the proper high season hadn't started yet. What would turn out to be a
common thing along this trip is that drivers on the other direction waved to
say hi. Even people on motorcycles (many of them Brazilian tourists) were also
saying hi.

The first stop of the day was at the Ranita de Darwin trail in the Amarillo
sector of the Pumalin NP. Nobody was here, only some boot marks on the dusty
road indicated the presence of someone somewhere. With nobody in sight, I
quickly did the trail. The trail itself is a path through the forest sometimes
muddy but with wooden planks to cross some of them. Seen
a Ranita de Darwin is very difficult as they are very small, however I saw
woodpeckers and other birds could be heard.

## Rain and cold on the rise

With a bit of rain every now and then, water falling from the mountain sides
could frequently be seen from El Amarillo to the south. The first big lake on
the road is the Yelcho. So far the road hasn't been difficult but once you reach
the lake it starts to climb. The lake cannot be seen much once you pass the
hanging bridge after Puerto Cardenas because of tall trees, the few lookouts
are not very good as the electricity cables block the view.

The first big climb is the "cuesta" Moraga. This climb is not difficult, but
closer to the peak patches of snow could be seen on the side of the road. The
cold and rain, made for a very cold descent into Villa Santa Lucia. This small
village was almost erased from the map after a landslide, caused by high
temperatures and rain near the Yelcho glacier, buried part of the town on 2016.
The consequences can still be seen as a section of the road is still being
repaired and in the museum dedicated to the tragedy.

As a small town, there were 2 hostels, a camping and some cabanas.
Although the camping was covered, a few pools of water were under the roofs.
Of the 2 hostels, the owners of my preferred ones were out and hadn't come back.
So I went to the other one, because the cold was setting in (but was still
relatively early). The hostel wasn't well kept, understandably because the owner
may have only time for the store in the first floor. After showering and having
a soup, I went to my room to rest. Here I noticed that the room was not the
best, with a hole in the wall (which I covered with tape) and holes in the roof
were some bird poop has accumulating.

So I decided to give the other place a go. Fortunately, the owners were back, so
I moved there. This one was more comfortable, and I spent a good time talking to
the owners, who shared stories about other travelers and how was living through
the pandemic here. They also gave some recommendations about good camping sites
to stay further south.

The next morning was raining more heavily and colder, but the road was very flat
and it took me little time to arrive at La Junta.

## Days at La junta

La Junta is a bit smaller than Chaiten, but the dogs were tamer. At the time
of my arrival it was getting sunny with scattered clouds and windy. After a well
deserved lunch I found accommodation. There was no point on rushing since the
next national park I wanted to visit would be closed for a few days before I
could get there. So I stayed in a good place for 2 nights.

After putting my clothes and cycling shoes to dry and taking a good shower, I
walked to a lookout in the hill next to town for a panoramic view of the town.
With passing clouds beams of light illuminated the green fields in the farms
around town and the snowed mountains at the distance. I spent probably a good
30 minutes there enjoying the view and taking pictures.
Food in town was not easy to find with only a couple of restaurants and stores
open. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the local salmon, puyes (small fish which are
locally produced and sold at high prices to international hotels) and nalca
(giant rhubarb) as dessert.

The good weather didn't last. The day after I was thinking of going to the
Rosselot lake and visit the confluence of the Palena and Rosselot rivers,
but the rain started early and didn't stop until the end of the day. Even
going out to get food without getting wet was difficult. So I just rested
that day and sorted my things.
