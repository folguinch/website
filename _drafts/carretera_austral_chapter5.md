The day started as planned.
A cold early morning breakfast, not in a rush but moving around to sort things and to keep warm.
After packing my tent and loading the bike, I enjoyed the sunrise in the small beach of the camping site and saw a couple of toninas getting into the fjord.
To continue warming up, I headed to the Queulat NP entrance and arrived a bit ahead of the opening.
There workers were arriving and preparing to continue with the access road maintenance.

## The Ventisquero Colgante

The entrance to the NP was smooth.
To access the park reservations were necessary but payment had to be made at the entrance.
I was amongst the first group of people to enter the park, together with a couple of Chilean friends and a couple of foreign tourist.
After a quick debrief about which trails were open, I parked my bike and prepared to walk.
First to the lagoon (Laguna Tempanos) were I got a clear view of the glacier, but as was taking my last pictures a cloud started to form in front of the glacier.

I calculated that I had to leave by noon if I wanted to arrive at a good time to my next destination or in case I had any accident or longer than predicted stop.
So if I wanted to reach the lookout closer to the glacier I would had to run a bit.
With the pressure of time and the clouds forming on the mountains, I rushed to the lookout.
Even at a faster pace, I stopped at the few lookouts on the way, and even to listen and record a woodpecker singing.
The trail is relatively steep at the beginning, but after the climb it goes relatively flat with smooth ups and downs.
When I arrived to the lookout the hanging glacier was covered, only the water falling could be seen below the clouds.
Knowing the trail and that descending is usually faster, I waited for a while.
A friend told me that he waited for a couple of hours, I didn't have that much time, but I was satisfied after seen it from the lagoon.
I waited long enough that people I passed by on the way up and tourists that arrived later caught with me, then I rushed on the descent.

On the way down I saw a couple of foreign tourist, not quite convinced with continuing up, and one of the cyclists I met on the ferry of the second day.
Since he was wearing a lot of clothes in the ferry, I didn't recognized him, so in my rush down I only said hi and ask how he was doing.
Arriving at the parking I saw his bike and realized it was him.
I arrived to the parking at noon, had something to eat, refilled the water bottle and headed out.
