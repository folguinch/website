To end up the Carretera Austral part of my trip, here is a list of the things I carried.
For my trip I carried 4 panniers and a handlebar bag.
The handlebar bag was mostly for my camera, camera spare battery and wallet.
The tent was strapped on the rear rack, though with the gravel and friction the waterproof bag got a few holes.

## Front panniers
